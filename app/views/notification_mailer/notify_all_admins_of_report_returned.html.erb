Hello <%= @admin.full_name %>,

A report <%= link_to report_url(@report), report_url(@report) %> from <%= @report.user.try(:full_name) %> has been returned.

<% if @validation.comments_for_provider.present? %>
  Remarks to Provider:

  <%= @validation.comments_for_provider %>
<% end %>

<% if @validation.comments_for_admin.present? %>
  Remarks to Admin:

  <%= @validation.comments_for_admin %>
<% end %>

You may wish to review the report and contact the provider to assist them with any changes that need to be made.

Many thanks,
GRASP
